      <h1>Humor</h1>
      Born crime is the most interesting book I have ever read, Trevor tends to
      find humor in every situation like the time at school they used to beat
      him but still, he is not crying he is laughing. He tends to speak about
      the real world in his book like the time his mother bought for him Knock
      off brand abidas and he starts telling her that the shoes are fake and his
      mother told him that he should be grateful that he gets an extra one.
      There is also another time where he pops in the kitchen and the
      grand_mother starts think that there is something in the house until when
      they came home and they started searching and they find the shits and they
      thought it’s a demon and they started praying He also used humor when
      there were men who wanted to steal him and he started talking to them in
      the same language Trevor has used humor to find friends when he went to
      school and he was able to speak multiple languages and from there he
      started to get many friends This book has shown me the importance of
      laughing and the way it can make you have most of the thing you wanted to
      like the way Trevor has got friends
