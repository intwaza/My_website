      mechanics, handsome and the world knew him as a good person but at home he
      is toxic, he was born in Tzaneen. After sometimes Abel and Patricia
      married and gave birth to their son Andrew. In the Tsonga culture where
      Abel came from, they had a belief that men had to lead family and men are
      the ones to instruct at home and women do housework that's what Abel also

      refused and this has made Abel bring new rules. This has made Trevor start

      <h1>Humor</h1>
      Born crime is the most interesting book I have ever read.Trevor tends to
      find humor in every situation .In school they used to beat him but instead
      of crying he was laughing. He tends to speak about the real world in his
      book like the time his mother bought for him Knock off brand adidas and he
      told her that the shoes are fake.His mother told him that he should be
      grateful that he gets an extra one. There is also a time where he poops in
      the kitchen and the grandmother thought that there was something in the
      house until when they came home and they started searching.They found it
      and they thought it’s a demon and they started praying .He also used
      humour when there were men who wanted to steal from him and he started
      talking to them in the same language .Trevor used humour to find friends
      when he went to school and he was able to speak multiple languages.This
      book shows the importance of humour and how it can make you have most of
      the things you want like how Trevor got friends.
